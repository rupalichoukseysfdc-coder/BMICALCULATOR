The BMI Calculator App is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component based application that allows users to enter their height and weight and instantly calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).
It uses LWC for UI and Apex for server-side calculation logic.This project demonstrates how Salesforce can be used to build real-time, interactive health utilities using modern UI and backend logic
